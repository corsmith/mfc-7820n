# Brother MFC-J430W open driver (wifi scanner)

## Reasons

Brother MFC-J430W has already scanner driver and you can download [here](https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=it&lang=it&prod=mfcj430w_all) but that are prebuilt binary (x86/x64) and source code isn't public. My problem was that I wanted use scanner in my RPi4 but those driver not works on ARM architecture. In the end I solved this issue throught workaround using a vps... recently I resumed the project and I found a solution (partially thanks to [this](https://github.com/davidar/mfc7400c/)) and imho I think this is better than any workaround.
